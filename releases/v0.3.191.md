## What's Changed

### ✨ New Features
- Added Laser Mode with toggle to switch between CNC and laser visualization
- Added laser beam visualization that syncs with G-code power commands
- Added laser power level segments showing varying power intensity along toolpaths
- Added support for .gc file extension

### 🔧 Improvements
- Laser beam now uses red color with live power display from DRO
- Beam indicator moved from logo to power LED for clearer feedback
- Laser beam is off by default and hidden during rapid (G0) moves
- S0 moves no longer render the beam, matching real laser behavior
- Skipped Z axis in start-from-line preamble for laser mode safety
- Improved XY positioning when starting from a specific line in laser mode
- Calibrated laser head 3D model for more accurate visualization

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed override slider reset button, value bouncing, and missed commands
- Fixed power segment clustering with equal-width position bins
- Fixed laser beam positioning during toolpath rendering
- Fixed start-from-line preamble bug in laser mode
