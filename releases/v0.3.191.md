## What's Changed

### ✨ New Features
- Added Laser Mode with toggle to switch between CNC and laser visualization
- Added laser beam visualization with real-time power display and red beam indicator
- Added laser power level segments showing power distribution across the toolpath
- Added support for .gc file extension
- Added beam visibility control from the DRO panel

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed override slider reset button, value bouncing, and missed commands
- Fixed power segment clustering with equal-width position bins
- Fixed laser beam positioning and corrected behavior during rapid moves
- Fixed start-from-line preamble skipping Z moves in laser mode
- Fixed XY positioning in start-from-line preamble for laser mode

### 🔧 Improvements
- Improved laser mode UI with polished beam indicator using power LED instead of logo
- Hidden G0 rapids and laser beam during rapid moves for cleaner laser visualization
- Skipped rendering and turned off beam for S0 (zero power) moves in laser mode
- Enhanced start-from-line safety and beam visibility controls
- Calibrated laser head model for more accurate visualization
